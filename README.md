### Setup ###
#### To setup the code first open a new terminal and git clone the repositiory and then cd into the main folder:
``` 
cd 411proj
```
#### Then, once you're in that file, you need to start up your virtual environment with the following sequence of commands. If you've already made a venv in /api you should just have to run the last line.
```
cd api
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
#### Then, the command line prompt should instead look like this:
```
(venv) $ _
```
#### If you haven't yet imported any packages, you will need to run the following commands:
```
fill these in later
should just be pip installs I think
```
#### Finally, to run the code open another terminal, let's call in Terminal B, and there, from the 411proj directory, run
```
yarn start
```
#### In the original terminal, Terminal A, run 
```
yarn start-api
```
#### Now the app should be running and you can open it up by clicking on the links in the terminals.
#### To leave the venv you will want to just use the command:
```
deactivate
```
